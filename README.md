# What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

# Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- Clarifies Ideas and Concepts: Wireframing helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process.
- Facilitates Communication: It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.
- Identifies Usability Issues: By focusing on the user interface structure, wireframing helps identify potential usability issues early on. This can include navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.
- Saves Time and Resources: Early detection of design flaws and usability issues saves time and resources that would be spent on revisions later in the design and development stages.

# Key Elements in a Wireframe
- Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

# Types of Wireframes
- Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
- High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

**Differences between low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes**
: Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, rough sketches that focus on layout and functionality without detailed visuals, used early in the design process to plan structure and gather quick feedback, while high-fidelity wireframes are detailed, polished designs with colors, images, and real content, used later to finalize visuals and prepare for development.

**When they are used in the design process**:
Low-fidelity wireframes are used early in the design process to explore ideas, plan structure, and gather quick feedback on layout and functionality.
High-fidelity wireframes are used later in the design process to refine visual details, test user experience, and prepare the final design for development.
